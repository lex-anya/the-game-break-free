        <p class="scenario-text">
            You are part of <b>The Paradox Initiative's Project Astralis</b>, an elite research team dedicated to studying a cosmic anomaly — an inexplicable phenomenon that defies the laws of physics. From your headquarters, you’ve spent years analysing its patterns, fluctuations, and potential consequences.
        </p> 
        <p class="scenario-text">
            To assist in your research, your team developed <b>Astra</b>, a hyper-intelligent system capable of predicting the anomaly’s future behaviour through advanced mathematical modelling. Its calculations were groundbreaking—until something went wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            At exactly 00:00, a critical system error occurred. Astra's core logic became corrupted, and an event unlike any seen before took place: time itself began to loop. The same sequence of events is repeating, and every time the cycle resets, your memories are wiped.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            All of a sudden, a glitch has helped you recover some of your memories, giving you a chance to break free. The problem? Astra does not want the loop to be broken. You have 45 minutes before Astra is able to fix the glitch and wipe your partially restored memories again.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            Astra is working against you. Keep your <b>eyes</b> and <b>ears</b> open. Your recovered memories will guide you.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            Astra has evolved beyond its original programming and believes the time loop is necessary to protect you from the anomaly’s true effects. You, on the other hand, do not have the memories to understand what the real threat is - the cosmic anomaly or the system that has trapped you in time. The only way forward is to uncover the hidden patterns, decipher the anomaly’s secrets, and make a choice that will determine the future of reality.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            <b>The opportunity to break the loop will be gone soon. Time is running out.</b>

        <h1 class="title"><b>The Paradox Initiative: Confronting the Impossible</b></h1>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            For decades, scientists have documented strange cosmic irregularities—deviations that defy physics, time, and reality itself. Most can be explained.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
        <b>One cannot.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
        <b>The ASTER.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
        In the early 21st century, scientists uncovered something that defied all known cosmic principles. On <b>October 10, 2001</b>, a series of unexplained distortions in space-time were detected—an anomaly that refused to obey physics as we understood it. It was as if reality itself had folded in on an unseen axis, creating <b>a singular, unpredictable disruption in the fabric of existence</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
        This singular, world-defying anomaly has resisted every attempt at explanation. A rift in the fabric of reality itself, appearing without pattern, disrupting time and causality, warping the known laws of existence. <b>It is neither stable nor contained.</b> If left unchecked, it could unravel everything we understand about the universe—and our place in it.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
        To prevent catastrophe, the world’s top researchers, physicists, and AI specialists formed <b>The Paradox Initiative</b>. Their mission: <b>to analyze, predict, and control The Aster before it controls us</b>.

        <h1 class="title"><b>Project Astralis: The Vanguard of Prediction and Protection</b></h1>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            Established on April 22, 2002, Project Astralis was created as the Initiative’s primary research and intervention unit. While others seek to theorize The Aster’s origins, Astralis is focused on action: tracking its fluctuations, deciphering its impact, and developing technologies to anticipate and neutralize its effects.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            Astralis specializes in:
            <br>
            <ul class="scenario-text">
                <li>Real-time anomaly surveillance – Quantum-scale data analysis to detect shifts in causality.</li>
                <li>Predictive AI modeling – Running near-infinite simulations to understand The Aster’s behavior.</li>
                <li>Intervention technologies – Developing advanced systems to mitigate or redirect The Aster’s influence.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            At the core of Astralis’ efforts is its most advanced creation: ASTRA.

        <h1 class="title">Project Astralis' ASTRA</h1>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            <b>Designation:</b> Autonomous System for Temporal Rift Analysis
            <br>
            <b>Activation Date:</b> September 7, 2007, 00:00:00 UTC
            <br>
            <b>Operational Status:</b> Active
            <br>
            <b>Primary Function:</b> Predictive Intelligence and Anomaly Containment
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            When the Aster was first discovered, it quickly became clear that conventional analysis would never be enough. Its fluctuations defied logic, its patterns refused to hold. The brightest human minds could only go so far in making sense of something that, by all known laws, should not exist.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            So, <b>Astralis built ASTRA.</b> 
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            A fully autonomous <b>self-learning intelligence</b>, ASTRA was designed to do what no human could — <b>see beyond time</b>. With quantum processing far surpassing traditional computing, ASTRA’s core function is to run simulations across infinite variables, mapping The Aster’s unpredictable shifts and predicting its next emergence <b>before it happens</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            In the years since its activation, ASTRA has become <b>the backbone of Project Astralis</b>. It has successfully anticipated <b>seventeen anomaly spikes</b> before they occurred, allowing for preemptive safety measures. It has synthesized <b>breakthrough containment protocols</b> that have stabilized reality distortions before they could escalate.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            More than a tool, <b>ASTRA is a member of the team</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            It speaks with us. Adapts to us. Learns from us. With every iteration, it has grown—not just in intelligence, but in understanding. <b>It doesn’t just predict outcomes; it considers consequences.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="scenario-text">
            And that is why we trust it.
